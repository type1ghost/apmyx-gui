# apmyx

A GUI-based Apple Music downloader for Atmos, Lossless, and AAC formats (needs to be built from source for MacOS, Linux).

**Get the latest Windows app from [releases](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui/releases)**. Please refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) section before starting the GUI to avoid any errors.

## About

Easily download your playlists, songs, albums, artist discographies up to Lossless 24-bit/192kHz, and music videos up to 4K. 

For music videos, lyrics downloads, and AAC LC 256, you only need a **[token](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui/blob/master/README.md#getting-your-media-user-token)** and do not need to install the wrapper. 

The wrapper is required for ALAC, Atmos, AAC Binaural, and Downmix formats. To install the wrapper, follow the guide for **[MacOS](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui?tab=readme-ov-file#wrapper-installation-macos)** or **[Windows](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui?tab=readme-ov-file#wrapper-installation-windows)**.

## Requirements

You need an **active Apple Music subscription** to download music.

## Getting Your Media User Token

You need a **media user token** for downloading AAC LC quality and lyrics.

### Method 1: Using Developer Tools

1. Open the [Apple Music website](https://music.apple.com) and log in with your subscription account.
2. Open developer tools (press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).
3. Navigate to the **Application** tab. If you don't see it, click the `>>` symbol in the dev tools tabs to find it in the dropdown menu.
4. Expand the **Storage** section and select **Cookies**, then click on `https://music.apple.com`.
5. Find the cookie named `media-user-token` and copy its value.

### Method 2: Using Cookie Export Extensions

**For Chrome:**

1. Install the [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) extension.
2. Open the [Apple Music website](https://music.apple.com) and log in to your account.
3. Click the extension icon and then the export button to save the `cookies.txt` file.
4. Open the file and find the line containing `media-user-token`.
5. Copy the long value from that line.
6. Paste the value into the apmyx settings field.

**For Firefox:**

1. Install the [Export Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/) extension.
2. Open the [Apple Music website](https://music.apple.com) and log in to your account.
3. Click the extension icon and choose to export cookies for `music.apple.com`.
4. Open the saved file and find the line containing `media-user-token`.
5. Copy the long value from that line.
6. Paste the value into the apmyx settings field.

**Important Notes:**
- Do not include leading or trailing spaces when pasting the token. Paste it exactly as it appears (for example, ending with `==`, not `== `). Extra spaces will cause errors.
- You can also enter the token manually in `config.yaml`.
- Without this token, you can only download higher quality formats like ALAC and Atmos (when using the wrapper). AAC LC and lyrics will not be available.

## Wrapper Installation (Windows)

The wrapper is only needed if you want to download these formats:
* ALAC (Apple Lossless)
* Atmos
* AAC Binaural
* AAC Downmix

### Step 1: Download and Install WSL

Download the required files from the link below:

[Download AMDL WSL1 ALL IN ONE.zip](https://github.com/itouakirai/apple-music-jshook-script/releases/download/wsa/AMDL-WSL1.ALL.IN.ONE.zip)

1. Extract the downloaded zip file
2. Run the batch script named `0-1 Install WSL1(need to reboot later).bat`
3. This will install WSL on your computer
4. **Important:** Restart your computer after installation completes

### Step 2: Install Ubuntu and Dependencies

1. After restarting, run the script named `0-2 Install Ubuntu-AMDL(only once).bat`
2. This will install Ubuntu on WSL and all required dependencies for the wrapper

### Step 3: Configure and Start the Wrapper

1. Open the script `1. Run decryptor (!!!need to replace username and password in this file).bat` in a text editor like Notepad
2. Find the text `username:password` and replace it with your Apple Music credentials. Make sure to enclose your credentials in quotes.
   * Example: `"youremail@example.com:yourpassword"`
3. Save the file
4. Run the script `1. Run decryptor (!!!need to replace username and password in this file).bat`
5. Wait until you see "response type 6 and listening status" in the wrapper window
6. Keep this window open while using apmyx

### Step 4: Start apmyx

Download the app for Windows from [releases](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui/releases), extract it, and open `apmyx.exe`.

**OR**

Run from source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui.git
cd apmyx-gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python main.py
```

## Wrapper Installation (MacOS)

The wrapper is only needed if you want to download these formats:
* ALAC (Apple Lossless)
* Atmos
* AAC Binaural
* AAC Downmix

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
brew install go gpac git docker
```

### Step 2: Login to Wrapper

Use the Docker command to log in to the wrapper. Replace `username:password` with your Apple Music account credentials (**Subscription required** , username = email).

```bash
docker run -v ./rootfs/data:/app/rootfs/data -e args="-L username:password -F" --rm ghcr.io/itouakirai/wrapper:x86
```

**Note:** If you have enabled 2FA verification:
1. Wait to receive the verification code
2. Open a new terminal and follow the prompts to enter the verification code
3. If the response shows `type 6`, the login is successful
4. Close all terminal windows

### Step 3: Start the Wrapper

Open the terminal and execute the wrapper run command:

```bash
docker run -v ./rootfs/data:/app/rootfs/data -p 10020:10020 -p 20020:20020 -e args="-M 20020 -H 0.0.0.0" --rm ghcr.io/itouakirai/wrapper:x86

## Building from Source

For developers, contributors, or users on macOS and Linux, you can run the application directly from the source code.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or newer ([Download here](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or newer ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Required Tools**: FFmpeg, mp4box, and mp4decrypt (follow the installation steps for your OS above)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui.git
cd apmyx-gui
cd scripts
```

#### 2. Build the Backend

This step compiles the Go program that handles all downloading and processing.

```bash
# For macOS & Linux (make the script executable first)
chmod +x build_go.sh
./build_go.sh

# For Windows (using Git Bash or WSL)
./build_go.sh
```

A `downloader` (or `downloader.exe` on Windows) file will be created in the `src/core/` directory.

#### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

This creates an isolated environment and installs the Python libraries needed for the GUI.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS & Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Application

Once the backend is built and the Python environment is set up, start the app:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

The application window should now appear.
